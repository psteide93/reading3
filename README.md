| Input     | Output    |
|-----------|-----------|
|"Alligator"| "small"   | 
|  "Cat"    | "wide"    |
| "Debra"   | "wide"    | 

I would suppose this function takes a string, any string, switches the case to all lowercase and if it matches the string "alligator" and if it matches, then it will return a string of "small" if it doesnt match, it will return a string of "wide"
